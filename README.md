Abstract -- COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first case of COVID-19 emerged from
China on Dec. 2019. Millions of people have been affected by this
virus and lakhs of people lost their lives, their jobs due to this
ongoing Novel COVID-19 Pandemic. It is of absolute importance
to identify the future infected cases and the virus spread rate
for prior preparation in the healthcare services to avoid deaths.
It is the most challenging real-time problem for forecasting the
spread of COVID-19. We will be using the COVID-19 dataset
that is available on Kaggle and we will perform predictions using
ARIMA and Prophet time series forecasting models.
